# Kotlin with Spock

This setup lets you write the code in Kotlin while it is
using Groovy Spock for testing purposes.

Spock is great for data-driven testing, exception tests and mocking!
While mixing different languages can be a chore, it might be worth it
due to its great feature set.

Find more info about on its [project page](http://spockframework.org/).

## Run Tests

```shell script
./gradlew test
```

Or start them via IntelliJ IDEA
